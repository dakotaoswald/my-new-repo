* **Inheritance:** The child class Terreria inherited two strings from the parent class Game.

* **Polymorphism/ override:** The example method is called during the runtime to change the string for the Terarria class.

* **Encapsulation:** The getter and setter method in the Terraria class is used to set a rating and retreive it later on.
